# Control Flow

Reference switch.js for code examples

if/else statements make binary decisions and execute different code based on conditions.
All conditions are evaluated to be truthy or falsy.
We can add more conditional statements to if/else statements with else if.
switch statements make complicated if/else statements easier to read and achieve the same result.
The ternary operator (?) and a colon (:) allow us to refactor simple if/else statements.
Comparison operators, including <, >, <=, and >= can compare two variables or values.
After two values are compared, the conditional statement evaluates to true or false.
The logical operator && checks if both sides of a condition are truthy.
The logical operator || checks if either side is truthy.
The logical operator !== checks if the two sides are not equal.
An exclamation mark (!) switches the truthiness / falsiness of the value of a variable.
One equals symbol (=) is used to assign a value to a variable.
Three equals symbols (===) are used to check if two variables are equal to each other.

.forEach() is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and returns undefined.
.map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.
.filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.
All iterator methods can be written using arrow function syntax. In fact, given the succinctness and the implicit return of arrow function syntax, this is quickly becoming the preferred way to write these types of method calls.
You can visit the Mozilla Developer Network to learn more about iterator methods (and all other parts of JavaScript!).
Additional iterator methods such as .some(), .every(), .reduce() perform different functions.
